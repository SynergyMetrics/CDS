# An Open Framework for Aggregating Human Distress Indicators

## Abstract

This repository contains a non-commercial, open-source prototype of an open framework for aggregating human distress indicators, producing the Composite Distress Score (CDS) a single composite score unifying existing indicators (e.g., hunger, inequality, conflict, governance) for crisis tracking and early warning. The CDS uses established composite index methods in a transparent, flexible, and action-oriented way, without introducing new mathematical operations. This prototype is offered to researchers, humanitarian organizations, and developers as a basis for further exploration.

## Why This Exists

The world tracks indicators of human suffering – hunger, conflict, inequality, and governance – but rarely in one place, and rarely in a way that surfaces who needs help most, right now. While existing indices measure specific dimensions (e.g., inequality or governance), the CDS seeks to capture how these compound into real-world distress. This prototype aggregates well-known metrics (e.g., Gini coefficient, conflict deaths, displacement) into a single score. It’s not a solution. It’s a tool for thought—and an invitation for others to build something better. If it helps someone prioritize care where it’s most needed, it’s done its job.

This framework builds entirely on publicly available indicators from trusted sources like the United Nations, World Bank, Freedom House, and others. The CDS does not aim to replace these datasets but aggregates them to highlight systemic distress in an actionable way, encouraging users to engage with the original data for deeper analysis. It’s a humble signal aggregator, designed to complement existing metrics and support rapid, informed responses.

## What Is the CDS?

The Composite Distress Score (CDS) is a simple composite score generated by a framework that aggregates normalized indicators of societal distress into a single value in the [0,1] range, where 0 indicates minimal distress and 1 indicates maximal distress. The framework is designed to be:
- **Transparent**: Clear methodology and open-source code.
- **Adaptable**: Supports static and potential adaptive weighting for different contexts.
- **Actionable**: Offers a starting point for crisis prioritization or early warning systems.

This prototype is shared under a non-commercial license to encourage exploration and improvement by the community. It’s a proof-of-concept, not a production-ready tool, and would likely require a larger organization to scale effectively.

## Methodology

### Indicator Selection and Normalization

The framework aggregates existing indicators, normalized to a [0,1] scale, where 0 indicates minimal distress and 1 indicates maximal distress. Indicators are selected for relevance to societal crises and data availability. Examples include:

- **Hunger**: \( s_{\text{hunger}}(r,t) = 1 - \frac{\text{caloric intake per capita}}{4000} \), assuming caloric intake is 0–4000 kcal/day.
- **Inequality**: \( s_{\text{inequality}}(r,t) = \frac{\text{Gini index}}{100} \), scaling the Gini coefficient (0–100).
- **Conflict Deaths**: \( s_{\text{conflict}}(r,t) = \min(1, \frac{\text{deaths per 100,000}}{50}) \), with 50 as a threshold.
- **Displacement**: \( s_{\text{displacement}}(r,t) = \min(1, \frac{\text{IDPs + refugees per 100,000}}{1000}) \).
- **Governance**: \( s_{\text{governance}}(r,t) = 1 - \frac{\text{Freedom House Score}}{100} \), where higher distress corresponds to lower freedom.
- **Mental Health**: \( s_{\text{suicide}}(r,t) = \min(1, \frac{\text{suicides per 100,000}}{30}) \).

Thresholds are based on expert consensus, statistical analysis, or historical data (e.g., UN, World Bank, Freedom House). Qualitative indicators (e.g., oppression) rely on established indices to ensure transparency, though they may not fully capture nuanced experiences.

### Static CDS Formulation

The CDS is calculated as a weighted sum of normalized indicators:

\[ \text{CDS}(r,t) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot s_i(r,t) \]

Where:
- \( \text{CDS}(r,t) \): Score for region \( r \) at time \( t \).
- \( s_i(r,t) \): Normalized indicator \( i \).
- \( w_i \): Weight for indicator \( i \), with \( \sum w_i = 1 \).

**Weighting Options**:
- **Equal Weighting**: \( w_i = \frac{1}{n} \).
- **Expert Consensus**: Weights set via stakeholder input (e.g., prioritizing hunger in famine-prone areas).
- **Statistical Methods**: Weights based on principal component analysis (PCA).

### Example

For a region in 2024:
- Conflict: \( s_{\text{conflict}} = 0.9 \), Hunger: \( s_{\text{hunger}} = 0.7 \), Inequality: \( s_{\text{inequality}} = 0.5 \), others = 0.3.
- With equal weights (\( w_i = \frac{1}{6} \)), CDS = 0.55, indicating high distress.

### Towards an Adaptive Framework

The static CDS uses fixed weights, which may not capture dynamic crises (e.g., sudden displacement spikes). An adaptive version could adjust weights dynamically:

\[ \text{CDS}(r,t) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i(r,t) \cdot s_i(r,t) \]

\[ w_i(r,t+1) = \frac{w_i(r,t) + \eta \cdot s_i(r,t)}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} (w_j(r,t) + \eta \cdot s_j(r,t))} \]

Where \( \eta \geq 0 \) is a learning rate. This formulation draws inspiration from learning-rate-style updates in adaptive systems but is untested and included as an illustrative concept for future exploration.

### CDS as an Alert and Diagnostic Tool

The CDS works in two stages to support crisis awareness:
- **Alert**: A high CDS score (close to 1) flags regions or populations under significant distress, acting as a quick triage signal.
- **Diagnostic**: The individual indicator scores (e.g., hunger, conflict) show what’s driving the distress, pointing to possible areas for intervention.

This approach aims to help users quickly spot crises and understand their causes without replacing detailed analysis or local expertise. It’s a starting point for prioritizing action.

## Possible Uses

The CDS could support:
- **Crisis Tracking**: Monitor distress trends across regions or time.
- **Early Warning**: Detect rapid score increases as crisis signals.
- **Resource Prioritization**: Guide humanitarian aid or policy focus.
- **Community Exploration**: Serve as a starting point for researchers or organizations.

This is a prototype, not a production-ready tool. Scaling it would require robust data pipelines and institutional support.

## Known Limitations and Considerations

- **Data Gaps**: Crisis zones often lack real-time data, requiring imputation or proxies.
- **Subjectivity**: Indicator selection and thresholds involve judgment, risking bias.
- **Linear Aggregation**: The static model may miss non-linear interactions (e.g., conflict worsening hunger). Future work could explore alternatives.
- **Manipulation Risk**: Scores tied to aid could incentivize data falsification. Multi-source validation is recommended.
- **Scope**: The CDS measures systemic distress, not individual experiences.

- Building a strategy for retrospective recalculation to keep historical data consistent when indicators or methods change, supporting reliable trend analysis.
